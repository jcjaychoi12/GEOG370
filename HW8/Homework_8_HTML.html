    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>
        For the map, I first isolated Mecklenburg County from a map of the US. Then, I imported in the data for the churches and the public schools as points. From there, I started
        with creating a 1 mile buffer around the public schools, which resulted in a circular polygon with a radius of 1 mile. Then, I used the intersection method to see if there 
        were any churches within that 1 mile polygon, which represents churches that are at most 1 mile from a public school. I asked this question in order to see which churches 
        would be a great choice for my children and my family (as well for other families). By going to churches that are near my children's schools, it will be easier for them to 
        see their friends at church.
