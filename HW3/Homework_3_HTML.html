    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>
        Before importing any sort of map into QGIS, I first downloaded the Indicatrix Mapper 
        plugin into QGIS. This plugin allows Tissot's indicatrix to be calculated based on
        the given projection. After this, I imported the vector map into the program, and then
        on the bottom right corner of the window, there is an indicator that tells the user
        what the current projection is. If you click on that, you'll be able to change
        the projection. The plugin will also automatically recalculate Tissot's indicatrix.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries to keep the map as equidistant as possible, as indicated by
        the grid lines between the circles being equal length. However, in preserving the 
        distance, the shape and size are sacrificed. As the projection moves toward the 
        poles, the shape gets streched horizontally and is enlarged.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries to portray the curvy nature of Earth, and so tries to 
        curve the projection in 2D. This causes the center of the map, i.e. the equator and 
        the prime meridian, to be more accurate. However, as the projection gets more and more
        curved at the edges, the projection sacrifices shape and area at the western and eastern
        edges.

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries to conserve the shape of countries, however in doing so causes the 
        size and distance to be distorted. As the projection goes towards the poles, the size and 
        distance is increased. A notable effect of this is that Greenland seems to be as big
        as the African continent, but in reality Greenland is only about 1/5 of the size of Africa.

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries to portray the Earth's curvature, as well as tries to conserve 
        distance. However, in doing so, the entire projection causes the map to be streched
        vertically, and this effect is more noticeable as you go towards the poles.

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries portray the globe as the surface of a cylinder of equal diameter
        and height as the sphere. This causes the distance of countries to be conserved, but in 
        return the shape is sacrificed. As projection moves towards the poles, the projection 
        streches the countries horizontally.

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries to portray the globe as the surface of a cone of equal base diameter
        and height as the sphere. This causes the point of the cone, which is demonstrated as being 
        the North Pole, to be more accurate, as well as portray the world as being viewed from the 
        "top" of the globe. However, as the projection moves away from the center, which is equivalent
        to moving towards the south,the distortion of size and shape is greatly intensified. The shape 
        and size gets streched horizontally, as well as its size being increased.

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries to portray the globe as the surface of a cone of equal base diameter
        and height as the sphere (similar to the World Equidistant Conic projection). This time, the 
        projection tries to keep the vertical distances (from north to south) as equidistant as possible.
        Also, the horizontal distances are also equidistant, however only in their angular distance from
        the center (North Pole). However, in doing so, the map is distorted in shape and size as the projection
        moves toward the edge, i.e. as the projection moves towards the South Pole.

    <h2>NSIDC EASE Grid Global</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries to balance the conservation of distance and area. As the projection
        moves toward the poles, the distance and area are both increased, but not as drastic
        as some of the other projections. However, in conserving distance and area, the shape 
        is greatly distored, even at the equator where is it is stretched more vertically in the 
        equator and streached more horizontally near the poles.

    <h2>World Eckert V</h2>
    <h3>
        This projection tries to conserve all three aspects of map-making: distance, shape and size. 
        This projection also tries to display the curvature of the globe on a flat plane. This projection
        is the most balanced out of the projections on this page. As the projection moves towards the poles,
        the size is increase only a bit, the shape is relatively kept (though the western and eastern edges
        are more distorted), and the distances between countries also increase only by a bit.
